# MCP Business Assistant - Streamlit Prototype

A working prototype demonstrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) concepts using Streamlit and Python.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### 3. Open in Browser
The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`

## üéØ How to Use

### Step 1: Connect Tools
- Use the sidebar to connect business tools (Asana, QuickBooks, Google Analytics, etc.)
- Each connection simulates real MCP integrations
- Watch the dashboard update as you connect more tools

### Step 2: Ask Questions
- Use quick action buttons for common queries
- Or type custom questions in natural language
- Examples:
  - "Generate executive summary"
  - "What's our team workload?"
  - "Show financial performance"
  - "Are there any high-priority support tickets?"

### Step 3: Get AI Insights
- AI responds using data from ALL connected tools
- Responses change based on which tools are connected
- See unified insights that would normally require checking multiple systems

## üîß Features Demonstrated

### Core MCP Concepts
- **Tool Connectivity**: Simulate connecting real business applications
- **Unified Queries**: Ask questions that span multiple data sources
- **Contextual AI**: Responses adapt based on available data
- **Security Model**: Visual indicators showing secure connections

### Business Intelligence
- **Executive Summaries**: Comprehensive overviews from multiple tools
- **Project Management**: Real-time project status and team workload
- **Financial Analytics**: Revenue, expenses, and invoice tracking
- **Customer Support**: Ticket management and satisfaction metrics
- **Marketing Insights**: Website analytics and social media performance

### Interactive Dashboard
- **Live Metrics**: Real-time data from connected tools
- **Query History**: Track and revisit previous AI interactions
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear connection status and data flow

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
MCP Streamlit App
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MCPToolManager      # Manages tool connections and mock data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MCPQueryProcessor   # Processes natural language queries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Streamlit UI        # Interactive web interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mock Data Layer     # Simulates real business tool APIs
```

## üé® Customization

### Add New Tools
1. Edit `tool_manager.tools` dictionary
2. Add mock data in `_initialize_mock_data()`
3. Create query processing logic in `MCPQueryProcessor`

### Modify Queries
- Update `process_query()` method to handle new question types
- Add new quick action buttons
- Customize AI response formats

### Extend Dashboard
- Add new metrics in the sidebar dashboard
- Create visualizations using Plotly
- Implement real-time data updates

## üîÆ Real-World Implementation

This prototype simulates what a real MCP implementation would provide:

### Production Features
- **Real API Connections**: Connect to actual business tools via their APIs
- **Authentication**: OAuth flows for secure tool access
- **Real-time Data**: Live data synchronization from connected systems
- **Advanced AI**: More sophisticated natural language processing
- **Custom Integrations**: Support for proprietary business systems

### Security & Compliance
- **Data Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive business data
- **Access Controls**: Granular permissions for different team members
- **Audit Logs**: Track all AI queries and data access
- **Compliance**: GDPR, SOC2, and industry-specific requirements

## üìä Sample Queries to Try

1. **Executive Overview**:
   - "Generate my weekly executive summary"
   - "What's our overall business performance?"

2. **Project Management**:
   - "Which projects are behind schedule?"
   - "Show me team workload distribution"

3. **Financial Analysis**:
   - "What's our current financial status?"
   - "How much revenue did we generate this month?"

4. **Customer Support**:
   - "Are there any urgent support tickets?"
   - "What's our customer satisfaction score?"

5. **Marketing Performance**:
   - "How is our website performing?"
   - "Show me social media engagement metrics"

## üöÄ Next Steps

### For Developers
- Implement real API connections
- Add authentication flows
- Create custom business logic
- Deploy to production environment

### For Business Users
- Identify key business tools to connect
- Define important business queries
- Establish data governance policies
- Plan team training and adoption

## üí° Why MCP Matters

This prototype demonstrates how MCP transforms business operations:

- **Before MCP**: Check 10+ different tools, manually compile reports, context-switch constantly
- **With MCP**: Ask one question, get unified insights, focus on decisions not data gathering

The result: **3 hours of weekly prep time ‚Üí 15 minutes**, better insights, faster decisions, and more strategic focus.
